# Intro to Python programming

The folder contains solved problem sets provided in the course [MIT 6.0001 Introduction To Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) as taught in fall of 2016.

It is an interesting course for beginners in programming and the lectures are quite good. The answers i provided in the scripts are to my level of satisfaction accurate but feel free to fork, improve on the answers and don't forget to add a pull request so i can review the updates.

Happy coding!🎉️🤩️
